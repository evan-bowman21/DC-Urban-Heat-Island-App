## Description
Extreme heat in urban environments pose serious health and justice challenges to local government and civil society groups. The objective of this app is to provide a tool to analyzes heat sensitivities across DC census tracts. We provide a tool that allows users to statistically model the correlates of the Heat Sensitivity Exposure Index (HSEI), Heat Sensitivity Index (HSI) and Heat Exposure Index (HEI). A user can find the relevant socio-demographic and health correlates of these extreme heat metrics on census tract basis.

## Use Case
We imagine this app being used by someone within the DC governmentâ€™s Department of Energy and Environment, Health and Human Services, or by a civil society group such as a community association or non-profit to best plan for extreme heat events. The purpose of the visual representation and statistical modeling is to assist in the formulation of long term policy making as well as short term assistance to individuals looking for reprieve from extreme heat. policy that attempts to mitigate the occurrences of heat-related health incidences.

## Data
The data used in this app comes from a variety of sources. Our main source comes from the Heat Sensitivity Exposure Index. The data was found on Open Data DC and has a variety of sociodemographic variables for each census tract (percent poverty, percent people of color, etc.), as well as some environmental variables explaining heat indexes (percent impervious surface, percent tree color, mean air temperature, etc.).
